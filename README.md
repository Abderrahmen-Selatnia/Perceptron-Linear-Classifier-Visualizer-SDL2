# Perceptron Linear Classifier Visualizer with SDL2

This repository contains implementations of a perceptron-based linear classifier visualizer written in **C** and **C++**, using **SDL2** for graphical visualization. The visualizer demonstrates the dataset classification and the decision boundary dynamically. The dataset is generated and visualized as points with two classes, while a line representing the perceptron-based classifier oscillates to simulate training adjustments.

## Features
- **Dataset Generation**: Randomly generates a dataset with two classes, saved as a CSV file.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Displays the dataset and updates the perceptron's decision boundary in real-time.
- **Implementation in Both C and C++**: Offers both language options for developers.
